  title: Fishy tester
  shortDescription: Fetch a fish near the river.
  description: Great ! Now that I have the potion ready, I need to test it. There
    might be a "small" probability that I failed this cure. So testing it on a Human
    is not an option. Could you please find a fish ? There might be some near the
    river on the pontoon.
  thankYouMessage: Thank you adventurer ! Now, let's hope this cure works and that
    the village can be saved from the disease.
